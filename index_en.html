        <p class="explicacion_p" id="explicacion_p">One of the peculiarities of the human brain is 
            that it can read a word even if all its letters are not in order, 
            as long as the first and last letter are in the correct position.
            <br>
            This, of course, has its nuances, as it is necessary not to change 
            the length of the words and to have some idea of what is being read.
            It also applies to having difficulties with words that we don't
            know or that are not part of our usual vocabulary.
            <br>
            The point is that we read words and not individual letters. 
            That's why we invite you to verify this.
